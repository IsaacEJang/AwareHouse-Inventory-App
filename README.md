Mobile Architect &amp; Programming

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app "Aware House" was developed to streamline inventory management for warehouse operations, addressing needs for real-time stock updates, and efficient inventory adjustments.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Necessary screens included a dashboard for inventory overview, item addition and removal interfaces, and notification settings, all designed with simplicity and ease of use to keep the user's workflow uninterrupted.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

Coding the app involved iterative development, starting with core functionality before refining features, and employing strategies like modular design for easy updates and maintenance in future iterations.


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Functional testing was conducted through unit tests and user scenario simulations to ensure reliability; this critical process highlighted bugs early and confirmed the app's effectiveness in meeting user needs.


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Innovation was required in implementing the notification system, which needed to function without SMS permissions, leading to a flexible design that catered to both permission-granted and permission-denied user cases.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The inventory dashboard was particularly successful in demonstrating my ability to create an intuitive user interface that seamlessly integrated real-time data updates with user interactions.
